    <h2>TO ENSURE DATA SECURITY AND EFFICIENT DATA ACCESS CONTROL FOR CLOUD STORAGE USING IMMEDIATE REVOCABLE TIMESTAMP MA-ABE SCHEME</h2>
    <p style="font-size: large;">This Project is designed for data owners and data users. The project is mainly focused on giving security to the data which is present in the cloud. The data owners upload the data into the cloud and the owner will set the timestamp to the file, the data will be stored in the encrypted form, where the other data users or owners cannot be able to read the file. If the data want to be read or to open, the data users should have the secret key. By using the secret key the data users can read and download the file within the timestamp set to the file. If the secret key is available but the timestamp set to the file is expired then the file cannot be opened. In this way the security is given and it enhances the access control for cloud storage.</p>
